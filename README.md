# network-lab-21sp

This is a repo for the Computer Network Lab of 2021 Spring.

During the course, I got inspired by others. That's why I want to post my code here.

Most of my commit messages are refined, which should be easy to understand.

And NOTICE!!!! My tcp-stack labs are not completed: there are some flaws that I do not fix,
yet I will not continue learning the subject in at least 12 months.

Please remember the Honor Code, which is important to every programmer. You can use my code
IF AND ONLY IF you have cited this repo.

Last but not the least, thanks @CacaoGatto and @RenzoTsai's repos. Their elegant designs
really helped me a lot.
